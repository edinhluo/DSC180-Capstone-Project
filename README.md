# COVIDPoolTesting

## Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic that has persisted for more than two years has been combated by efficient testing strategies that reliably identifies positive individuals to slow the spread of the pandemic. Opposed to other pooling strategies within the domain, the methods described in this paper prioritize true negative samples over overall accuracy. In the Monte Carlo simulations, both nonadaptive and adaptive testing strategies with random pool sampling resulted in high accuracy approaching at least 95% with varying pooling sizes and population sizes to decrease the number of tests given. A split tensor rank 2 method attempts to identify all infected samples within 961 samples, converging the number of tests to 99 as the prevalence of infection converges to 1%.
